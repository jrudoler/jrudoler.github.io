Most of my work is related to analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings - measurements of the changing electrical potential in people's brains caused by neurons firing.

I'm interested in signal processing - how to best analyze a noisy signal and learn about real-world phenomenon like human cognition. A tremendous amount of effort goes into trying to understand brain recordings.

Another topic of interest is how we can use machine learning tools to actively predict a person's behavior based on on their brain activity. We're still a ways off from mind-reading, but it's cool stuff. 

## EEG analysis

- I investigate how a method of distinguishing pink noise in brain recordings from true brain rhythms helps us understand what patterns of brain activity actually relate to successful memory encoding and retrieval. Presented at the *Context and Episodic Memory Symposium* in August 2021.

- Analyzing changing electrical potential requires choosing a reference point for the measurement. When we have some set of electrodes recording brain activity in distinct spatial locations in the brain, should they all be referenced the same way? To a common electrode? To their nearest neighboring electrode? To a weighted sum of other electrodes? I discuss a number of approaches, explain how they act as variable "spatial filters", and compare their utility for classifying brain state and memory success.
