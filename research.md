Most of my work is related to analyzing electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings - measurements of the changing electrical potential in people's brains caused by neurons firing.

I'm interested in signal processing - how to best analyze a noisy signal and learn about real-world phenomenon like human cognition. A tremendous amount of effort goes into trying to understand brain recordings.

Another topic of interest is how we can use machine learning tools to actively predict a person's behavior based on on their brain activity. We're still a ways off from mind-reading, but it's cool stuff. 

## EEG analysis

I investigate how a method of distinguishing pink noise in brain recordings from true brain rhythms helps us understand what patterns of brain activity actually relate to successful memory encoding and retrieval.
