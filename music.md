Here's a sampling of the music I've been listening to:
- *OK Orchestra*, AJR
- *Change of Scenery II*, Quinn XCII
- *Simple - Single*, Sam Fischer
- *Blood Harmony*, FINNEAS

And a quick plug for the a cappella album I produced in college: [DynamIX](https://open.spotify.com/album/1I6PeHr9GHensKAAa79PgG)
