I'm a graduate student at The Wharton School, pursuing a PhD in Statistics and Data Science. 

Before this, I worked full-time doing software engineering and computational cognitive neuroscience research at Pennâ€™s [Computational Memory Lab](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) with Michael Kahana. 
While working for the lab I finished a part-time engineering Master's in Data Science, which included a thesis supervised by [Konrad Kording](https://kordinglab.com/). I attended Penn for undergrad as well, majoring in Physics & Astronomy with a Concentration in Business and Technology, along with minors in English and Music. 

I was drawn to statistics and machine learning through a desire to find my place in a world overwhelmed with data. I am exciting about working on many things (probably too many), but you can read an overview of my past [research](https://jrudoler.com/Research/) and current interests. 
I love to think about the world both experientially and mathematically, and earnestly believe we need both perspectives in order to have any idea what's going on around us. 

I am always excited to learn more or think about something new. Please shoot me an email or [schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/jrudoler/30min) if you'd be interested in chatting with me or maybe collaborating on a project!
