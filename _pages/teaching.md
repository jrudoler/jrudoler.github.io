I owe a lot to the wonderful teachers and mentors I've had over the years (not just in mathematics -- it was one of my English professors who convinced me to do a PhD!)

I appreciate the opportunity I have now to try and share some insight with students. I find the process rewarding and illuminating.

I have served as a TA for the following courses at Wharton:
- STAT6130 (Regression Analysis for Business)
- STAT4010 (Sports Analytics Captsone)
- STAT4100 (Data Collection and Acquisition)

I am also in the process of developing a new course for introductory statistics and data science. Titled "Understanding Uncertainty", the course avoids much of the standard statistical machinary in favor of an approach that focuses heavily on sampling and programmatic simulation. 

The course website contains all of the lecture material and assignments and can be found [here](https://jrudoler-teaching.github.io/understanding-uncertainty/).
