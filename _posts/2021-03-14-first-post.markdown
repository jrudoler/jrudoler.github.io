I've never been much of a blogger, but I guess there's no time like the present. I have a lot of ideas, so maybe I'll put them here instead of talking my friends' ears off. 

I'm interested in posting about some of the following:
- Life vignettes that feel poignant and/or educational. I find that writing or talking about important experiences helps me to concretize and digest them. 
- Sports! I could talk about Joel Embiid for days on end. #EMVPiid
- Statistics, and statistical decision-making
- Music - I think I have good taste, at least this will help me track what I've been listening to.
- Books - I'm a painfully slow reader, but I have a soft spot for quality literature. I particularly like modern American Fiction.
